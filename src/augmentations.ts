/**
 * Teach ream's `ContainerBindings` what `container.make(...)` returns for the
 * tokens inker binds.
 *
 * ream declares that interface open on purpose: it registers its own entries
 * and expects each package to contribute the ones it owns. Nothing filled
 * these in, so resolving by the string token answered `unknown` and every call
 * site had to assert a type it could not prove.
 *
 * Loaded from the package barrel, so importing Inker anywhere in the
 * application is enough — nobody writes a `declare module` of their own.
 *
 * Type-only, and ream stays an OPTIONAL peer: nothing here reaches a runtime
 * import, and a `declare module` for a specifier that does not resolve is
 * simply inert.
